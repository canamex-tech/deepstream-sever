# Branch API Reference
Branch components are similar to Piplines in the way they're used to manage and link Child components when transitioning to states of `ready`, `paused`, and `playing`. Unlike Pipelines, Branches can not contain Source components, and must be added as a Child to a [Demuxer or Splitter Tee](/docs/api-tee.md). 

#### Branch Construction and Destruction
Branches are constructed by calling [dsl_branch_new](#dsl_branch_new) or [dsl_branch_new_many](#dsl_branch_new_many), and destructed by calling [dsl_branch_delete](#dsl_branch_delete), [dsl_branch_delete_many](#dsl_branch_delete_many), or [dsl_branch_delete_all](#dsl_branch_delete_all). Deleting a Branch will not delete its child components but will unlink then and return to a state of `not-in-use`. The client application is responsible for deleting all child components by calling [dsl_component_delete](/docs/api-component.md#dsl_component_delete), [dsl_component_delete_many](/docs/api-component.md#dsl_component_delete_many), or [dsl_component_delete_all](/docs/api-component.md#dsl_component_delete_all).

#### Adding and Removing Components
Child components -- Inference Engines, Trackers, Tilers, Demuxers, Splitters, On Screen-Displays, and Sinks -- are added to a Branch by calling [dsl_branch_component_add](#dsl_branch_component_add) and [dsl_branch_component_add_many](#dsl_branch_component_add_many). A Branch's current number of child components can be obtained by calling [dsl_branch_component_list_size](#dsl_branch_component_list_size).

Child components can be removed from their Parent Branch by calling [dsl_branch_component_remove](#dsl_branch_componet_remove), [dsl_branch_component_remove_many](#dsl_branch_componet_remove_many), and [dsl_branch_component_remove_all](#dsl_branch_component_remove_all)

#### Adding and Removing Branches from Tees
Once created, Branches are added to a Demuxer or Splitter (Tees) by calling [dsl_tee_branch_add](#dsl_tee_branch_add) and [dsl_tee_branch_add_many](#dsl_tee_branch_add_many). A Tee's current number of child components can be obtained by calling [dsl_tee_branch_list_size](#dsl_tee_branch_list_size).

Branches can be removed from their Parent Tee by calling [dsl_tee_branch_remove](#dsl_tee_branch_remove), [dsl_tee_branch_remove_many](#dsl_tee_branch_remove_many), and [dsl_tee_branch_remove_all](#dsl_tee_branch_remove_all)

## Methods

### *dsl_branch_component_add*
```C++
DslReturnType dsl_branch_component_add(const wchar_t* branch, const wchar_t* component);
```
Adds a single named Component to a named Branch. The add service will fail if the component is currently `in-use` by any Branch. The add service will also fail if adding a `one-only` type of Component, such as a Tiled-Display, for which the Branch already has. The Component's `in-use` state will be set to `true` on successful add. 

If a Branch is in a `playing` or `paused` state, the service will attempt a dynamic update if possible, returning from the call with the Branch in the same state.

**Parameters**
* `branch` - [in] unique name for the Branch to update.
* `component` - [in] unique name of the Component to add.

**Returns**
* `DSL_RESULT_SUCCESS` on successful add. One of the [Return Values](#return-values) defined above on failure

**Python Example**
```Python
retval = dsl_source_csi_new('my-camera-source', 1280, 720, 30, 1)
retval = dsl_branch_new('my-branch')

retval = dsl_branch_component_add('my-branch', 'my-tilerâ€™)
```

<br>

### *dsl_branch_component_add_many*
```C++
DslReturnType dsl_branch_component_add_many(const wchar_t* branch, const wchar_t** components);
```
Adds a list of named Component to a named Branch. The add service will fail if any of components are currently `in-use` by any Branch. The add service will fail if any of the components to add are a `one-only` type of component for which the Branch already has. All the component's `in-use` states will be set to true on successful add. 

If a Branch is in a `playing` or `paused` state, the service will attempt a dynamic update if possible, returning from the call with the Branch in the same state.
